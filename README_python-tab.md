Python! <img src="https://simpleicons.org/icons/python.svg" height="16"> I have been using Python practically since I started coding, and is my goto for command-line apps and shell-scripting! I have been coding in Python since essentially day 1. I remember when I was 10 I programmed an awful command-line game in Python (which I still have a copy of but REFUSE to share with anybody for the sake of my dignity as a developer).

## 📝 Favorite text editors
![VS Code logo](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/1378056/download/png/32) 

Visual Studio Code -- the signature text editor of a webdev (or Atom if you dare to defy). A teeming extension ecosystem and some nice themes make it a strong contender.

![Vim logo](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/4691236/download/png/32) 

Neovim is really good, and second in command (but it's also really unconventional)..! Lovely shortcuts, but a steep learning curve makes it a struggle to get into it, especially since spenind the time learning all of these shortcuts would, ironically, hinder my workflow and I'm too lazy to learn them separately. (Emacs is good too, but Vim is more minimal 😄)

![Atom logo](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/4691249/download/png/32) 

Atom is... Atom. Emacs is better. But seriously, Emacs naming copy-pasting "yanking"..? For that, I put Atom #1.
## 🎮 My top 3 games
